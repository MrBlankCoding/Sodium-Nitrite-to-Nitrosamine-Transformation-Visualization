# Sodium Nitrite to Nitrosamine Transformation Visualization

This project visualizes the chemical transformation of sodium nitrite to nitrosamine, which can occur during digestion of cured meats. The visualization shows a scientifically accurate representation of the molecular structures and the step-by-step chemical process.

## Chemical Process Visualized

1. **Initial State: Sodium Nitrite (NaNO₂)**
   - Sodium nitrite as found in cured meats

2. **Step 1: Formation of Nitrous Acid**
   - NaNO₂ + H⁺ → HNO₂ + Na⁺
   - Stomach acid protonates the nitrite ion

3. **Step 2: Decomposition of Nitrous Acid**
   - HNO₂ → NO⁺ + OH⁻
   - Nitrous acid decomposes into nitrosonium ion and hydroxide

4. **Step 3: Formation of Nitrosamine**
   - R₂NH + NO⁺ → R₂N-N=O
   - The nitrosonium ion reacts with secondary amines in proteins
